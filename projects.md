## Completed Projects

### Can we find Synonyms and Antonyms from Word Embedding Analogy?
_Computational Linguistics project, WS 2018-2019, Saarland University, Germany_  

__Links:__ [Github](https://github.com/SouravDutta91/synonym-antonym-analogy)  
__Advisor:__ [Prof. Alexander Koller](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~koller/)  
__Short Abstract:__ Analyzing if we can find new words referring similar word embedding pairs (GloVe) by Analogy relationships.  

### Neural Multi-turn Chatbot
_Neural Networks Software Project, WS 2018-2019, Saarland University, Germany_  

__Links:__ Github link will be updated soon with report.  
__Advisor:__ [Prof. Dietrich Klakow](https://www.lsv.uni-saarland.de/?id=38)  
__Short Abstract:__ Designing and evaluating a neural multi-turn chatbot trained on movie dialogs corpus with attention-based model. My task was to evaluate the performance of the developed chatbot using BLEU score algorithms.  

### How good is a sequential treebank neural model for parsing?
_Grammar for Trees and Graphs seminar, WS 2018-2019, Saarland University, Germany_  

__Links:__ [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fxYPLmBNnDKT_8SMNWoWVm2vlnncyRbH/view)  
__Advisor:__ [Dr. Meaghan Fowlie](https://meaghanfowlie.com/), [Jonas Groswchitz](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~jonasg/)  
__Short Abstract:__ Analyzing if a neural sequential model trained on a treebank corpus is good enough to generate syntax parse trees for input sentences.
