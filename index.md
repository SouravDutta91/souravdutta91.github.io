## Hello!

I am a Masters student studying [Language Science and Technology](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/master/study-programmes/lang-lit/lst/description.html) in [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/nc/en/home.html), Germany. I am also a Research Assistant in the [Interactive Machine Learning](http://iml.dfki.de/) research group in [DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/) under the supervision of [Michael Johannes Barz](https://michael.barz.de/).

My research interests lie in Computational Linguistics and applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning principles to solve challenges in Natural Language Understanding, Processing and Generation. Some of my interests include (but not at all limited to):

* Machine Translation
* Question Answering
* Word Embeddings
* Language Modeling
* Information Extraction

When I manage to find some free time from all this, I try to either sing random songs, or hopelessly strum my guitar (really bad at it!), but I somehow end up watching anime instead.
