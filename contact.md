## Contact Me?

Do you want to talk about some project ideas related to NLP? Or maybe Machine Learning? Or maybe just anything random? Feel free to contact me.


You can probably find me in the Computational Linguistics department (building C7.2) or else inside the DFKI building in Saarland University campus. If not, I am probably at home sleeping! Shoot an email and I will get back to you.
